# 747-400
FG Aircraft | 747-400

The Boeing 747-400 is the best selling model of the 747 family. 
It has been superseded by the more economical and advanced Boeing 747-8.

All buttons/switches in the cockpit can be controlled using the mouse. 
Most buttons exist of a toggle, where clicking it toggles it either on or off. Switches can be turned clockwise with the left mouse button and counter clockwise using the middle mouse button.
Alternatively you can use the scroll wheel to cycle the switch left/right. Some buttons/switches have a cover on them, clicking it will either open or close it, so the button/switch can be pushed/turned.

Ground steering

As of FlightGear 2.6, the 744 has tiller steering, just like the real aircraft where the pedals only turn the nose wheel by a few degrees - to achieve optimal precision during takeoffs and landings. 
Use the tiller (747-400 > Tiller Steering) dialog to steer during taxiing.

You can also connect a separate joystick axis to the tiller control - just like in the real aircraft, where there is a separate control wheel.
Finally, you can also disable the separate tiller control and revert to the unrealistic behaviour of using pedals only to completely control the nose wheel (see 747-400 > Tiller Steering dialog).

Simplified procedures

Set the amount of fuel that you would like to carry along, by using the Fill button and slider in the Fuel and Payload dialog.
This will ensure the fuel is properly distributed among the seven (or eight, when the stabilizer tank is used) tanks.
