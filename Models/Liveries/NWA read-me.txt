Northwest Airlines Boeing 747-400 "Bowling Shoe" livery by E-Savageair

     



     In 1984, Boeing introduced an 'advanced' version of their 747-300 at the Farnborough air show in England.  The plane featured an increased wingspan, 
sporting 6'ft. winglets, composite materials, and a digital flight control system that can be managed by two crew; at first there was some concern about 
flying with only two pilots with no flight engineer coming from overseas airlines like Cathay Pacific, but Boeing convinced the airlines the 
Electronic Flight Instrument System(EFIS) would operate efficiently.  In the end on Oct 22, 1985 it was Eagan, Minnesota-based Northwest Airlines
who would become the launch customer, purchasing 10 aircraft that would be called the Boeing 747-451. 

     The aircraft rolled out on Jan. 26, 1988, and flew on Apr. 29, 1988, but there were problems in development: the aircraft's electronics was not only 
operating on the flightdeck, but it would power many of the services for the passengers, which became a big problem in development and would cause delays 
in deliveries because of different airline interior configurations, inexperienced workers, as well as electronic intergration problems on the flightdeck.  
But Boeing would resolve those issues by mid-1989, a lesson learned for future Boeing aircraft.

     The 747-451 was delivered Jan 26, 1989 to Northwest and flew the first revenue service on Feb 9, 1989, 20 years after the first 747 flight in 1969. 
Soon there after the prototype, N661US the paint being depicted was refurbished and joined the Northwest fleet. The aircraft were flying in the old 
'blue stripe' livery, but those colors were about change.  In fall of that year, designed by Landor Associates, Northwest unveiled their new and bold 
livery the employees called the "bowling shoe" livery and a new logo called the 'compass' logo; it was ingenious: it can look like a compass pointing 
northwest, or an 'n' or a 'w'.  The bold and handsome livery would be adorned on the fleet and was flown till 2003 when Northwest went a pearl-gray 
paint scheme.

    In 2008 Northwest and Delta Airlines would merge; most of Northwest's fleet would be handed over to Delta in which many of the aircraft
including 747-451 fleet and for that matter the prototype, will likely finish their service life in Delta colors.
